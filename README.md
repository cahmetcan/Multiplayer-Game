# Multiplayer Game with Cloudflare Workers

This multiplayer game has been created using Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Durable Objects, and it runs at the edge of the web. Users can connect to the server via WebSocket and join the rooms of their choice. They can communicate with other users in the room with minimal latency, providing a fast and enjoyable gaming experience. The project has been designed to be easily customizable and, when integrated with a beautiful frontend, can result in an impressive multiplayer game.
